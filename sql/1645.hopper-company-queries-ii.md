Write an SQL query to report the percentage of working drivers (working_percentage) for each month of 2020 where:


Note that if the number of available drivers during a month is zero, we consider the working_percentage to be 0.

Return the result table ordered by month in ascending order, where month is the month's number (January is 1, February is 2, etc.). Round working_percentage to the nearest 2 decimal places.

The query result format is in the following example.
```

## Solution 

和 [1635.\(Hard\)Hopper 公司查询 I](1635.hopper-company-queries-i.md) 题基本一样。

```sql
with recursive t AS
(
	SELECT 1 as month 
	UNION
	SELECT month+1 FROM t WHERE month<12
),
tm as 
(
    SELECT month, LEFT(DATE_ADD('2019-12-01',INTERVAL month MONTH),7) ym from t
)

SELECT month, 
	ifnull(ROUND(count(DISTINCT AcceptedRides.driver_id)/count(DISTINCT Drivers.driver_id)*100,2),0.00) working_percentage
from tm LEFT JOIN Drivers on DATE_FORMAT(join_date,'%Y-%m')<= ym
	LEFT JOIN Rides on DATE_FORMAT(requested_at,'%Y-%m') = ym
	LEFT JOIN AcceptedRides using(ride_id)
GROUP BY month;
```
