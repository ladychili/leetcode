Write an SQL query to report the number of grand slam tournaments won by each player. Do not include the players who did not win any tournament.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Players table:
+-----------+-------------+
| player_id | player_name |
+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | Nadal       |
| 2         | Federer     |
| 3         | Novak       |
+-----------+-------------+

Championships table:
+------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+
| year | Wimbledon | Fr_open | US_open | Au_open |
+------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+
| 2018 | 1         | 1       | 1       | 1       |
| 2019 | 1         | 1       | 2       | 2       |
| 2020 | 2         | 1       | 2       | 2       |
+------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+

Result table:
+-----------+-------------+-------------------+
| player_id | player_name | grand_slams_count |
+-----------+-------------+-------------------+
| 2         | Federer     | 5                 |
| 1         | Nadal       | 7                 |
+-----------+-------------+-------------------+

Player 1 (Nadal) won 7 titles: Wimbledon (2018, 2019), Fr_open (2018, 2019, 2020), US_open (2018), and Au_open (2018).

## Solution 

本质上是`Championships`宽表转长表的问题。

```sql
select player_id, Players.player_name, count(1) grand_slams_count
from 
(
    select year,'Wimbledon' tournament, Wimbledon 'player_id' from Championships
    union
    select year,'Fr_open' tournament, Fr_open 'player_id' from Championships
    union
    select year,'US_open' tournament, US_open 'player_id'from Championships
    union 
    select year,'Au_open' tournament, Au_open 'player_id'from Championships
) t inner join Players using(player_id)
group by player_id
```

还有一种做法，求`Players` 和 `Championships` 的笛卡尔积，sum相等的情况。

```sql
select  player_id, player_name,
    sum(player_id = Wimbledon) + 
    sum(player_id = Fr_open) + 
    sum(player_id = US_open) + 
    sum(player_id = Au_open) grand_slams_count
from Players cross join Championships
group by player_id
having grand_slams_count>0
```
